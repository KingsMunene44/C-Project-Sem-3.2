The proposed project is a student portal that aims to provide all necessary information 
regarding a student's academic progress and profile. The portal will be designed to allow 
students to access their personal information such as their name, registration number, age, year of admission, 
and email. Additionally, the portal will provide students with real-time updates on their
academic progress by displaying their current units and examination results. 
This will provide students with a comprehensive overview of their academic progress, 
allowing them to monitor their performance and identify areas of improvement.

The student portal will also include a fee structure section that will display 
detailed information about the cost of tuition, registration fees, and any other 
relevant financial information. This will provide students with a clear understanding 
of their financial obligations and help them to plan their finances accordingly. 
The portal will be accessible to both students and faculty members, enabling 
faculty members to monitor the academic progress of their students and provide 
support as needed. Overall, the student portal will be a valuable resource for 
students and faculty members alike, providing a comprehensive overview of a student's 
academic progress and profile.

We believe this isn't currently available at the current university's portal and a 
simple structured program can be written to visualize what the portal could do without 
the visual design component and real time data fetching capabilities.
